# Custom_ResNet_18
Custom ResNet 18 Implementation for Image Classification

This project is a systematic exploration of the impact of (1) increased depth and (2) residual connections in CNN based networks for image classification. Networks of depth 6, 12 and 18 were explored, with and without residual connections on the CIFAR-10 and iCubWorld 1.0 datasets.
